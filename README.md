OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT
Project:Simple Calculator
The project involves creating a simple calculator using Python. The calculator performs basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The user interacts with the calculator via a text-based menu, where they can select an operation and input numbers. The program processes the input, performs the calculation, and displays the result. It continues to run until the user chooses to exit. This project demonstrates fundamental programming concepts such as functions, loops, and conditional statements in Python.
